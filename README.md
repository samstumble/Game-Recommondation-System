🎮 Game Recommendation System using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning–based game recommendation system that suggests video games to users based on their preferences, play style, platform, graphics requirements, and past gaming behavior. The system uses similarity-based filtering to provide personalized recommendations with brief explanations.

🚀 Features

Personalized game recommendations

Content-based & similarity-based filtering

Cosine similarity for ranking games

User behavior analysis (playtime & preferences)

Implemented in Google Colab

Easy to extend with real datasets

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

Content-Based Filtering

Cosine Similarity

Feature Encoding (One-Hot Encoding)

Feature Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)

🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Google Colab

Pandas

NumPy
